### Running the code
The following instructions are assuming Ubunto as your OS, for other systems please make the necessary adaptations. 

It's a good idea to install the following python packages:
```sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-serial python-wxgtk2.8 python-scipy python-opencv ccache python-serial python-argparse```

It can be easily run by `python src/main.py` , or by importing the project in Eclipse with the help of the [pydev](http://pydev.org/) plugin. Hit 'q' to finish the program.
